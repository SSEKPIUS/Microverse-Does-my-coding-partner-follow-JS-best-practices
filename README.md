## About

"To-do list" is a tool that helps to organize your day. It simply lists the things that you need to do and allows you to mark them as complete. I will build a simple website that allows for doing that, and I will do it using ES6 and Webpack!


To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

## Prerequisites
### WebPack
First let's create a directory, initialize npm, install webpack locally, and install the webpack-cli
1. npm init -y
2. npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev

### Loading CSS
1. npm install --save-dev style-loader css-loader

### Loading Data
1. npm install --save-dev csv-loader xml-loader
